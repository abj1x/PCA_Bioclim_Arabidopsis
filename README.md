# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of bioclimatic continuous variables and Arabidopsis haplotype distribution
## approach used to assess correlation of LHY haplotypes with particular bioclimatic variables

## Description
can be used to prepare a PCA biplot as a ggplot2

This example used to prepare Figure 4b James et al. (2018) Global spatial analysis of Arabidopsis natural variants implicates 5'UTR splicing of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL in responses to temperature. Plant Cell Environ. 41(7) 1524-38.

Similar approach used to prepare Suppl. Figures S6b and S7
